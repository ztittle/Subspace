# RTSP Proxy Sample Application

This is a sample application that demonstrates proxying requests from an RTSP server (such as an IP Cam) to a WebRTC client.

## Running the sample

First, ensure that the .NET Core 3.1 SDK is installed.

Then execute `dotnet run` in this directory. 

Once up and running, launch a web browser to http://localhost:5000 and enter a valid RTSP URL and hit play.
